    "The journey to becoming an AI/ML Engineer in 2025 requires a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, data handling, and machine learning principles. This roadmap emphasizes both theoretical knowledge (math, algorithms, models) and practical implementation (Python, frameworks, cloud ML). It also includes optional paths in specialized areas like NLP, computer vision, and reinforcement learning, as well as emerging fields like generative AI and responsible AI practices.",
